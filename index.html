<p> <em>Project 1: Southworth Planetarium Logos</em> </p>

<p> My inspiration for this logo design came from the concept of the mesmerizing visual associated with celestial 
  elements. I wanted to create a design that felt dynamic and engaging while also being professional. The motion 
  of the purple and blue swirls represents the movement of celestial objects, and the yellow stars add a touch of 
  whimsy aesthetic and connection to the planetarium. I started with some rough sketches, exploring different concepts 
  of curves and stars. Once I had a design that I was happy with, I moved to Adobe Illustrator and started creating 
  the logo. I used the tools to create clean shapes and played with the colors. I went with purple and blue because 
  those are the colors that are usually associated with space. When it came to typography, I wanted it to complement 
  the logo without overtaking it so I went with a bold, sans-serif font. </p>

<p> <em>Project 2: Photo Manipulation Scenes</em> </p>

<p> My main goal for this project was to create a utopia that reflected my world of warmth, peace, and positivity. I wanted to design 
  a space that felt both whimsical and inviting, a place I would love to escape, especially during the current events happening in the 
  world right now. The concept of an alternate world naturally led me to consider elements that bring me comfort such as lots of cats, 
  nature, and a warm color palette filled with vibrant flowers. These are the first aspects I thought of that became the foundation of 
  my two scenes, which depict a surreal paradise with floating islands, cozy environments, and an abundance of furry friends. I am 
  currently reading a fantasy romance series, so my inspiration stemmed from a combination of fantasy landscapes that I got from those 
  books, as well as my love for cozy, nature-filled spaces.  I envisioned a world that merges reality with mystical elements, blending 
  the beauty of brightly colored gardens with floating islands, dreamy lighting, and a sense of peace. I also took inspiration from the 
  idea of a cat’s paradise, where they could roam freely, leap between mystical platforms, and relax in the hidden nooks of the trees. 
  I wanted my utopia to feel both adventurous and peaceful. The process of turning these ideas into artwork involved careful composition 
  and layering. I started by selecting a background that conveyed an ethereal quality such as sunset skies, dense forests, and vibrant 
  landscapes. Then, I introduced floating islands and ladders to create a mystical vertical world, making the environment feel expansive. 
  For the second scene, I focused on a cozy atmosphere within a hollowed-out tree, using small details like fairy lights, books, and a 
  plush couch to enhance the inviting “homey” ambiance. Color played a crucial role in unifying my alternate world. I leaned into warm 
  tones, golden hues, pinkish skies, and the rich greens of plants to create a comforting and dreamlike aesthetic. The vibrant flowers 
  helped make the landscapes feel alive, while the soft, glowing lights in the second scene added a sense of warmth and intimacy. </p>
