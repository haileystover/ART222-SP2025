<p> <em>Project Statement and Self-reflection</em> </p>
  
<p> My inspiration for this logo design came from the concept of the mesmerizing visual associated with celestial 
  elements. I wanted to create a design that felt dynamic and engaging while also being professional. The motion 
  of the purple and blue swirls represents the movement of celestial objects and the yellow stars add a touch of 
  whimsy aesthetic and connection to the planetarium. I started with some rough sketches, exploring different concepts 
  of curves and stars. Once I had a design that I was happy with, I moved to Adobe Illustrator and started creating 
  the logo. I used the tools to create clean shapes and played with the colors. I went with purple and blue because 
  those are the colors that are usually associated with space. When it came to typography, I wanted it to complement 
  the logo without overtaking it so I went with a bold, sans-serif font. </p>

<p> Looking at my final result, I think that the logo effectively captures the theme of space and movement, as well 
  as successfully connects to the Planetarium. If I were to evaluate this as if it weren't my own, I would ask if 
  the colors and elements work together and if any adjustments could make it feel more polished.  I would also ask 
  if the balance between the text and the design could be refined. Experimenting with different size ratios or 
  positioning would help create more cohesive, visual imagery. During the critique, I received feedback about the 
  waviness of my swirls. The swirls have some unclean edges and the student suggested that cleaning the swirls up 
  would make the overall design more polished, which I agree with. It was a bit hard because I have never used 
  Illustrator before, so I am still getting used to it. During this process, I learned more about the Illustrator 
  tools and how they work. I also learned the importance of iteration and critique. I felt confident in the design, 
  but outside perspectives were able to point out areas that needed improvement that I might not have noticed when 
  I submitted it. </p>

<p> <em>Project Statement and Self-reflection</em> </p>

<p> My idea came up after thinking, "What does an ideal world look like, and how does it make us feel?‚Äù 
  Everyone has different idea of what an ideal or perfect world looks like to them whether that is peace, nature, community, or 
  something entirely personal to themselves so to me my first scene is an overview of a whisical and dreamlike utopia, surrounded 
  by bright flowers, and mystical floating islands that serve as a place for cats to hang out. I added floating islands to merge 
  elements of fantasy and tranquility. The warm hues of the sky and the variety of brightly colored flowers contribute to the 
  ethereal feel I was going for. My aesthetic choices, like the floating islands, the ladders, and the luminscent waterfall, 
  create a sense of movement and interconnectedness, suggesting that my utopia is peaceful and energetic. The idea of including 
  cats is mainly because I love them and wish I had more than one haha, but I also added them to bring life and narrative to the 
  scene. On the islands, cats do different things, such as a cat drinking from the  waterfall and another jumping onto the island. I 
  also hid two cats within the garden below to show them peaking through the bright flowers. I made sure to make each island smaller 
  and more blurred than the one before to create the sense of depth within the image. For my editing choices, I decided to emphasize 
  a sense of wonder, by blending nature and imagination to craft my vision of paradise. For my second scene, I created a scene of a 
  perspective from on top of the floating islands. I love reading and I find sitting under trees and reading books peaceful, so on 
  this floating island I put a woman reading a variety of books. I added two cats to go along with the floating islands being a 
  sanctuary for them. To make it a bit more "homey" I put lights in the tree and added a glow to them so it looked like they were on. </p>

<p> Looking at the final results of both my scenes, I like how they turned out. I am not a digital artist, so stuff like this is a learning 
  curve, but I have used Photoshop a lot in the past, so I felt much more confident with this project than I did working on the logos in Adobe. 
  Feedback I got from a classmate was to add some shadows, specifically behind the women in the second scene, so that it has more depth. I 
  agree! Looking back, I can see how the women and the cats look a bit flat compared to their background, and adding those shadows based 
  on where the light source is will help combat the flatness of the image. Comparing both scenes, I like the first scene of my furhter view 
  of the utopia because I feel it is more viusally interesting, compositionally and colorwise, than the second scene. When I was creating 
  the second scene, I didn't want to add too much because I was keeping it all within the frame of the tree. After all, that is meant to be 
  the hangout spot so I did not want to make it too crowded to the point that it caused chaos. However, I think if I added decorations or 
  shelves that held activities on either side of the tree, it would feel more like a place where people spend hours hanging out there. </p>
