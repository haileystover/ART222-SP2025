<p> <em>Southworth Planetarium Logos</em> </p>
<img src="southworthplanetariumlogos1.png">
<p> My inspiration for this logo design came from the concept of the mesmerizing visual associated with celestial elements. 
I wanted to create a design that felt dynamic and engaging while also being professional. The motion of the purple and blue 
swirls represent the movement of celestial objects and the yellow stars add a touch of whimshiness and connection to the 
planetarium. I started with some rough sketches, exploring different concepts of curves and stars. Once I had a design 
that I was happy with, I moved to Adobe Illustrator and started creating the logo. I used the tools to create clean 
shapes and played with the colors. I went with purple and blue because those are the colors that are usually associated 
with space. When it came to typography, I wanted it to complement the logo without overtaking it so I went with a bold, 
sans-serif font. </p>

<p> Looking at my final result, I think that the logo effectively captures the theme of space and movement, as well as 
successfully connects to the Planetarium. If I were to evaluate this as if it weren't my own, I would ask if the colors 
and elements work together and if any adjustments could make it feel more polished.  I would also ask if the balance 
between the text and the design could be refined. Experimenting with different size ratios or positioning would help 
create more cohesive, visual imagery. During the critique, I received feedback about the waviness of my swirls. The 
swirls have some unclean edges and the student suggested that cleaning the swirls up would make the overall design more 
polished which I agree with. It was a bit hard because I have never used Illustrator before so I am still 
getting used to it. During this process, I learned more about the Illustrator tools and how they work. I also learned 
the importance of iteration and critique. I felt confident in the design, but outside perspectives were able to point out 
areas that needed improvement that I might not have noticed when I submitted it. </p>
