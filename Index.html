<p>Project Statement and Self-reflection</p>

<p> My inspiration for this logo design came from the concept of the mesmerizing visual associated with celestial 
  elements. I wanted to create a design that felt dynamic and engaging while also being professional. The motion 
  of the purple and blue swirls represents the movement of celestial objects, and the yellow stars add a touch of 
  whimsy aesthetic and connection to the planetarium. I started with some rough sketches, exploring different concepts 
  of curves and stars. Once I had a design that I was happy with, I moved to Adobe Illustrator and started creating 
  the logo. I used the tools to create clean shapes and played with the colors. I went with purple and blue because 
  those are the colors that are usually associated with space. When it came to typography, I wanted it to complement 
  the logo without overtaking it so I went with a bold, sans-serif font. </p>

<p> Looking at my final result, I think that the logo effectively captures the theme of space and movement, as well 
  as successfully connects to the Planetarium. If I were to evaluate this as if it weren't my own, I would ask if 
  the colors and elements work together and if any adjustments could make it feel more polished.  I would also ask 
  if the balance between the text and the design could be refined. Experimenting with different size ratios or 
  positioning would help create more cohesive, visual imagery. During the critique, I received feedback about the 
  waviness of my swirls. The swirls have some unclean edges and the student suggested that cleaning the swirls up 
  would make the overall design more polished, which I agree with. It was a bit hard because I have never used 
  Illustrator before, so I am still getting used to it. During this process, I learned more about the Illustrator 
  tools and how they work. I also learned the importance of iteration and critique. I felt confident in the design, 
  but outside perspectives were able to point out areas that needed improvement that I might not have noticed when 
  I submitted it. </p>

<p>Project Statement and Self-reflection</p>
  
<p> My main goal for this project was to create a utopia that reflected my world of warmth, peace, and positivity. I wanted to design 
  a space that felt both whimsical and inviting, a place I would love to escape, especially during the current events happening in the 
  world right now. The concept of an alternate world naturally led me to consider elements that bring me comfort such as lots of cats, 
  nature, and a warm color palette filled with vibrant flowers. These are the first aspects I thought of that became the foundation of 
  my two scenes, which depict a surreal paradise with floating islands, cozy environments, and an abundance of furry friends. I am 
  currently reading a fantasy romance series, so my inspiration stemmed from a combination of fantasy landscapes that I got from those 
  books, as well as my love for cozy, nature-filled spaces.  I envisioned a world that merges reality with mystical elements, blending 
  the beauty of brightly colored gardens with floating islands, dreamy lighting, and a sense of peace. I also took inspiration from the 
  idea of a cat’s paradise, where they could roam freely, leap between mystical platforms, and relax in the hidden nooks of the trees. 
  I wanted my utopia to feel both adventurous and peaceful. The process of turning these ideas into artwork involved careful composition 
  and layering. I started by selecting a background that conveyed an ethereal quality such as sunset skies, dense forests, and vibrant 
  landscapes. Then, I introduced floating islands and ladders to create a mystical vertical world, making the environment feel expansive. 
  For the second scene, I focused on a cozy atmosphere within a hollowed-out tree, using small details like fairy lights, books, and a 
  plush couch to enhance the inviting “homey” ambiance. Color played a crucial role in unifying my alternate world. I leaned into warm 
  tones, golden hues, pinkish skies, and the rich greens of plants to create a comforting and dreamlike aesthetic. The vibrant flowers 
  helped make the landscapes feel alive, while the soft, glowing lights in the second scene added a sense of warmth and intimacy. </p>

<p> Reflecting on my process, I feel that my ability to create a cohesive, immersive world was successful. The combination of fantasy 
  elements and realistic textures allowed my scenes to feel both magical and tangible. One challenge I faced was ensuring that all the 
  manipulated elements blended naturally. I had to adjust lighting, shadows, and perspective to create a seamless integration of objects 
  within the environment. For example, some feedback I got was to add some shadows, specifically behind the women in the second scene, so 
  that it has more depth and looks more seamless. Comparing both scenes, I like the first scene of my further view of the utopia because I 
  feel it is more visually interesting, compositionally and colorwise, than the second scene. When I was creating the second scene, I didn't 
  want to add too much because I was keeping it all within the frame of the tree. After all, that is meant to be the hangout spot so I did 
  not want to make it too crowded to the point that it caused chaos. However, I think if I added decorations or shelves that held activities 
  on either side of the tree, it would feel more like a place where people spend hours hanging out there. </p>
